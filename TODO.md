### Code Quality Standards (MANDATORY FOR ALL CHANGES)

**Check EVERY change before claiming complete:**
1. **Tests?** Persistent state → write test | Visual only → skip
2. **Retry?** Tier-1 saves → 5 retries | DB reads → 3 retries | Auth messages → 3 retries | UI/snapshots → no retry
3. **Logging?** Critical fails → `warn` | State changes → `log-verbose` | Hot loops → no logs
4. **Scope?** Config/server state → globals | Computation → locals | Game state → structs (never `*global-players*`)
5. **Data-driven?** Behavior in data files, not hard-coded | Generic (works for NPCs too), not player-only

**If you skip any of these, explain why in commit message.**

### Building and Testing
REMINDER:
**CRITICAL: Before claiming any task is complete, ALL tests must pass:**
```bash
make checkparens        # Verify balanced parentheses in all .lisp files
make ci                 # Cold compile + UDP handshake test (no GPU needed)
make smoke              # Full client/server smoke test with window (2s default)
make test-persistence   # Data integrity tests (serialization, migrations, invariants)
make test-security      # Security tests (input validation, exploit prevention)
make checkdocs          # Verify docs/foo.md exists for each src/foo.lisp```
**Never skip tests.** If you implement a feature but don't run all test targets, the work is incomplete.
**Write tests for:**
- ✅ **Data corruption risk**: Serialization, migrations, database writes
- ✅ **Invariants**: Things that MUST always be true (HP ≤ max, gold ≥ 0)
- ✅ **Backend equivalence**: Storage abstraction must work identically across backends
- ✅ **Player-facing bugs**: Anything that loses progress, duplicates items, corrupts saves
**Skip tests for:**
- ❌ **Visual bugs**: Rendering, animations, UI layout (manual testing fine)
- ❌ **Input handling**: Mouse clicks, keyboard (already tested via smoke test)
- ❌ **Gameplay feel**: AI behavior, movement smoothness, combat balance
- ❌ **Helper functions**: Utils that don't touch persistent state
**Rule of thumb**: If a bug loses player progress or corrupts their save, write a test. If it's just annoying or ugly, manual testing is fine.
## Documentation
Every `src/foo.lisp` must have a matching `docs/foo.md`. Run `make checkdocs` to verify.
Key design docs:
- `docs/db.md` - Persistence architecture, storage abstraction, write tiers
- `docs/migrations.md` - Schema versioning, migration functions, admin commands
- `docs/save.md` - Serialization format, durable vs ephemeral classification
- `docs/net.md` - UDP protocol, message format, snapshot streaming
- `docs/SERVER_PERFORMANCE.md` - Scaling strategies, bottleneck analysis
- `docs/movement.md` - Physics, collision, zone transitions
**REMINDER: If you update a feature, update the doc.**
## Important Reminders
- **ALL TESTS MUST PASS**: Before claiming work complete, run ALL test targets in order: `make checkparens && make ci && make test-persistence && make test-security && make checkdocs && make smoke`. No exceptions.
- **Never commit with unbalanced parens**: Run `make checkparens` before committing
- **CI must pass**: `make ci` runs cold compile + UDP handshake test
- **Data integrity tests must pass**: `make test-persistence` ensures no save corruption
- **Docs must be complete**: `make checkdocs` verifies every src file has matching documentation
- **Smoke test must work**: `make smoke` tests actual client/server with graphics
- **Storage abstraction is mandatory**: Never call Redis/database directly from game logic
- **Classify all new state**: Every field must be marked durable or ephemeral
- **Use correct persistence tier**: Tier-1 for critical, tier-2 for routine, tier-3 for logout
- **Write migrations for durable fields**: New persistent fields require schema version bump + migration function
- **Server is authoritative**: Clients send intents, not state
- **Test both backends**: Memory for dev, Redis for persistence testing
### When to Write Tests (Decision Criteria)
**Write tests for:**
- ✅ **Data corruption risk**: Serialization, migrations, database writes
- ✅ **Invariants**: Things that MUST always be true (HP ≤ max, gold ≥ 0)
- ✅ **Backend equivalence**: Storage abstraction must work identically across backends
- ✅ **Player-facing bugs**: Anything that loses progress, duplicates items, corrupts saves
**Skip tests for:**
- ❌ **Visual bugs**: Rendering, animations, UI layout (manual testing fine)
- ❌ **Input handling**: Mouse clicks, keyboard (already tested via smoke test)
- ❌ **Gameplay feel**: AI behavior, movement smoothness, combat balance
- ❌ **Helper functions**: Utils that don't touch persistent state
**Rule of thumb**: If a bug loses player progress or corrupts their save, write a test. If it's just annoying or ugly, manual testing is fine.

## Current Tasks / TODO

phase 1 and 2
CLIENT_PREDICTION_INTERPOLATION.md ?

## Future Tasks / Roadmap


check over the codebase to see if we need to address these concerns anywhere, also unit tests if need be. thanks.
- Basic rate limiting + sanity checks (intent frequency, movement bounds)
  The rate limiting and movement bounds sanity checks are separate security/performance concerns not addressed in that design document. These would prevent:
  - Clients spamming intents faster than tick rate
  - Clients claiming to move unreasonable distances


### Admin Commands - Tier B & C
**Tier B** (requires new infrastructure):
**Tier C** (nice to have):
See [docs/admin.md](docs/admin.md) for full spec.
