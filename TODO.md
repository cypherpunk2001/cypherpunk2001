## Current Tasks / TODO

Multi-step instructions:

- Please give wholistic code review deep dive of all current src files as-is in light of db.md, DB_CODE_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md, and DB_CODE_REVIEW_PLAN.md which is now supposed to be fully implemented! So search for deviances and rank bugs critical/high/med/low and propose way forward for fixing, without actually fixing anything at this time. Place these findings as final addendum within DB_CODE_REVIEW_IMPLEMENTATION_FINDINGS.md

- Create a brand new plan titled DB_CODE_REVIEW_IMPLEMENTATION_FINDINGS_PLAN_FINAL.md and propose a way forward to solve all findings in the new DB_CODE_REVIEW_IMPLEMENTATION_FINDINGS.md
