### Code Quality Standards (MANDATORY FOR ALL CHANGES)

**Check EVERY change before claiming complete:**
1. **Tests?** Persistent state → write test | Visual only → skip
2. **Retry?** Tier-1 saves → 5 retries | DB reads → 3 retries | Auth messages → 3 retries | UI/snapshots → no retry
3. **Logging?** Critical fails → `warn` | State changes → `log-verbose` | Hot loops → no logs
4. **Scope?** Config/server state → globals | Computation → locals | Game state → structs (never `*global-players*`)
5. **Data-driven?** Behavior in data files, not hard-coded | Generic (works for NPCs too), not player-only

**If you skip any of these, explain why in commit message.**

### Building and Testing
REMINDER:
**CRITICAL: Before claiming any task is complete, ALL tests must pass:**
```bash
make checkparens        # Verify balanced parentheses in all .lisp files
make ci                 # Cold compile + UDP handshake test (no GPU needed)
make smoke              # Full client/server smoke test with window (2s default)
make test-persistence   # Data integrity tests (serialization, migrations, invariants)
make test-security      # Security tests (input validation, exploit prevention)
make checkdocs          # Verify docs/foo.md exists for each src/foo.lisp```
**Never skip tests.** If you implement a feature but don't run all test targets, the work is incomplete.
### When to Write Tests (Decision Criteria)
**Write tests for:**
- ✅ **Data corruption risk**: Serialization, migrations, database writes
- ✅ **Invariants**: Things that MUST always be true (HP ≤ max, gold ≥ 0)
- ✅ **Backend equivalence**: Storage abstraction must work identically across backends
- ✅ **Player-facing bugs**: Anything that loses progress, duplicates items, corrupts saves
- ✅ **Security bugs**: Auth/session edge cases, privilege escalation (owning/controlling another entity), replay/forged intent packets, rate-limit abuse, and “double-login” / possession bypasses
**Skip tests for:**
- ❌ **Visual bugs**: Rendering, animations, UI layout (manual testing fine)
- ❌ **Input handling**: Mouse clicks, keyboard (already tested via smoke test)
- ❌ **Gameplay feel**: AI behavior, movement smoothness, combat balance
- ❌ **Helper functions**: Utils that don't touch persistent state
**Rule of thumb**: If a bug loses player progress or corrupts their save, write a test. If it's just annoying or ugly, manual testing is fine.
## Documentation
Every `src/foo.lisp` must have a matching `docs/foo.md`. Run `make checkdocs` to verify.
Key design docs:
- `docs/db.md` - Persistence architecture, storage abstraction, write tiers
- `docs/migrations.md` - Schema versioning, migration functions, admin commands
- `docs/save.md` - Serialization format, durable vs ephemeral classification
- `docs/net.md` - UDP protocol, message format, snapshot streaming
- `docs/SERVER_PERFORMANCE.md` - Scaling strategies, bottleneck analysis
- `docs/movement.md` - Physics, collision, zone transitions
**REMINDER: If you update a feature, update the doc.**
## Important Reminders
- **ALL TESTS MUST PASS**: Before claiming work complete, run ALL test targets in order: `make checkparens && make ci && make test-persistence && make test-security && make checkdocs && make smoke`. No exceptions.
- **Never commit with unbalanced parens**: Run `make checkparens` before committing
- **CI must pass**: `make ci` runs cold compile + UDP handshake test
- **Data integrity tests must pass**: `make test-persistence` ensures no save corruption
- **Docs must be complete**: `make checkdocs` verifies every src file has matching documentation
- **Smoke test must work**: `make smoke` tests actual client/server with graphics
- **Storage abstraction is mandatory**: Never call Redis/database directly from game logic
- **Classify all new state**: Every field must be marked durable or ephemeral
- **Use correct persistence tier**: Tier-1 for critical, tier-2 for routine, tier-3 for logout
- **Write migrations for durable fields**: New persistent fields require schema version bump + migration function
- **Server is authoritative**: Clients send intents, not state
- **Test both backends**: Memory for dev, Redis for persistence testing

## Current Tasks / TODO

- SSL? I think it's probably possible for a wifi sniffer to get peoples usernames and passwords from the unencrypted udp stream, correct me if i'm wrong. What SSL options are there? LEt's be careful. I happen to know that ssl packages are notorious for not compiling or being incompatible with various operating systems. Would be really nice to have a simple solution though that is guaranteed to work fine on linux windows and mac. But i think all those OS use different SSL implementations and versions. what do we do? Also we dont want to slow down networking at all, obviously latency is crucial, im not sure if ssl has any play in that. Let me know?

- encryption lib for passwords stored in the game database. recommendation? make sure its reputable and well maintained in common lisp world. Let me know?


## Future Tasks / Roadmap

This is a beta! Player unstuck option in ESC menu.
If a player gets stuck, he can press ESC and click button.
button runs function: server will try to move character up/down/left/right, if character coordinates do not significantly move, it seems player is indeed stuck (and not just trying to get a free teleport) and so he should be teleported back to a safe coordinate in his particular zone. How do we determine his safe coordinate he should teleport to, though? Hmmm.

### Admin Commands - Tier B & C
**Tier B** (requires new infrastructure):
**Tier C** (nice to have):
See [docs/admin.md](docs/admin.md) for full spec.

### More security unit tests - TODO
Not Tested (features don't exist yet):
- Economy bugs (no gold/currency system)
- Trade duplication (no trade system)
- Shop exploits (no vendors)
