## Current Task

At this point in development it's a good time to pause and ask, are we writing modular and reuseable code?

We need to ensure that we're making reuseable functions and objects that we can repurpose as we develop further the game worlds.

## Coding Guidelines: Modular & Reusable by Default

We are building reusable game systems, not one-off demo code.

**Bias:** write small, composable functions, CLOS objects and data-driven systems that can be reused by players, NPCs, and future worlds.

### Rules
- No gameplay logic in the main loop — it only orchestrates systems
- Entities hold data; systems implement behavior
- Rendering is separate from game logic
- Avoid hardcoded values that may vary later
- If it could apply to NPCs, write it generically now

### Agent Self-Check
Before outputting code, ensure:
- reusable beyond a single entity
- logic works without rendering
- behavior is not special-cased
- future client/server split wouldn’t break it

If unsure, refactor toward reuse.

## Performance Matters!

- Avoid per‑frame consing in hot loops: reuse rectangles, vectors, strings, and animation state.
- Cull off‑screen tiles/sprites; draw only what’s visible.
- Chunk the map (e.g., 32×32 tiles) and cache static chunks in a render texture.
- Keep entity data in arrays/structs, not lists; use object pools.
- Separate update/draw; keep animation state lightweight.
