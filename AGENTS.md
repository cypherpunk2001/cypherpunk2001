## Coding Guidelines: Modular & Reusable by Default

We are building reusable game systems, not one-off demo code.

**Bias:** write small, composable functions, CLOS objects and data-driven systems that can be reused by players, NPCs, and future worlds.

### Rules
- No gameplay logic in the main loop — it only orchestrates systems
- Entities hold data; systems implement behavior
- Rendering is separate from game logic
- Avoid hardcoded values that may vary later
- If it could apply to NPCs, write it generically now

### Agent Self-Check
Before outputting code, ensure:
- reusable beyond a single entity
- logic works without rendering
- behavior is not special-cased
- future client/server split wouldn’t break it

If unsure, refactor toward reuse.

---

## Performance Matters!

- Avoid per‑frame consing in hot loops: reuse rectangles, vectors, strings, and animation state.
- Cull off‑screen tiles/sprites; draw only what’s visible.
- Chunk the map (e.g., 32×32 tiles) and cache static chunks in a render texture.
- Keep entity data in arrays/structs, not lists; use object pools.
- Separate update/draw; keep animation state lightweight.

---

## Documentation Requirements

- When behavior changes in `src/*.lisp`, update the corresponding doc in `docs/*.md` (e.g., `src/movement.lisp` -> `docs/movement.md`).
