## Current Task

Perfect. Currently when painting, the base floor is black, now lets say i paint a basic green grass in an area, and put a water fountain sprite down in the middle of the grass. The water fountain may have some transparency in its sprite sheet. The result is what looks like a black void around the edges of the fountain, where you naturally think there should be grass, but the grass was lost when we painted over it. I think this is probably because painting has only 1 layer at the moment? We might need to give me a way to choose if I am painting on a base layer (for grass or something), and then to toggle to top layer (for object painting on top of the base layer). Can you implement this?

## Future Tasks / Roadmap

## Coding Guidelines: Modular & Reusable by Default

We are building reusable game systems, not one-off demo code.

**Bias:** write small, composable functions, CLOS objects and data-driven systems that can be reused by players, NPCs, and future worlds.

### Rules
- No gameplay logic in the main loop — it only orchestrates systems
- Entities hold data; systems implement behavior
- Rendering is separate from game logic
- Avoid hardcoded values that may vary later
- If it could apply to NPCs, write it generically now

### Agent Self-Check
Before outputting code, ensure:
- reusable beyond a single entity
- logic works without rendering
- behavior is not special-cased
- future client/server split wouldn’t break it

If unsure, refactor toward reuse.

---

## Performance Matters!

- Avoid per‑frame consing in hot loops: reuse rectangles, vectors, strings, and animation state.
- Cull off‑screen tiles/sprites; draw only what’s visible.
- Chunk the map (e.g., 32×32 tiles) and cache static chunks in a render texture.
- Keep entity data in arrays/structs, not lists; use object pools.
- Separate update/draw; keep animation state lightweight.

---

## Documentation Requirements

- When behavior changes in `src/*.lisp`, update the corresponding doc in `docs/*.md` (e.g., `src/movement.lisp` -> `docs/movement.md`).

## Testing Requirements

### Mandatory self-check

-   After **every code change**, run:

``` sh
make checkparens

make ci

make smoke

make checkdocs
```

#### `make checkparens`

Checks all `.lisp` files in `data/` and `src/` for balanced parentheses and general sexp structure.

- Reports results **per file**.
- Fails immediately on the first unmatched bracket/quote.
- Very fast and cheap to run.

This is the agent’s most useful quick check alongside `make ci`.

**Run it often** — before, during, and after making changes.

#### make ci

- cold SBCL start
- loads Quicklisp
- (ql:register-local-projects)
- (ql:quickload :mmorpg)
- compiles system
- no window, no GPU

#### make smoke

- loads system
- runs (mmorpg:run :max-seconds … :max-frames …)
- opens a real window briefly
- exits automatically

#### make checkdocs

After adding new code files, there should be new docs files to match.

After refactoring or removing code, leftover references to the old code should always be cleaned, updated or fixed.

- Checks that every `src/foo.lisp` has a matching `docs/foo.md`, errors if any are missing, otherwise prints a friendly reminder when all pass.
