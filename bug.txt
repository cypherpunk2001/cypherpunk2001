Zone Transition Bugs — Current State (2026-02-02)
==================================================

Bug 1: Click-to-move to another zone — character walks indefinitely
-------------------------------------------------------------------
When clicking on a location in an adjacent zone, the character transitions
to the new zone but then walks forever without stopping. The walk target
is never reached or cleared. The player must click again or press a key
to interrupt the movement.

Repro: In zone 1, click on a visible tile in zone 2. Character walks to
the edge, transitions, then continues walking in the new zone without
ever stopping at the intended destination.

Bug 2: Audio skips on zone switch
----------------------------------
A brief audio glitch/skip is audible when the zone transition fires.
The audio drops out momentarily during the switch.
