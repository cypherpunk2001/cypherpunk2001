Zone Transition Bugs — Current State (2026-02-02)
==================================================

Bug 5: Diagonal multi-hop fails for floor clicks (except extreme corner)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Floor click-to-move diagonal crossing only succeeds at the single most extreme
corner tile and only when clicking the nearest diagonal tile. In most other
positions/clicks the hop fails.

Repro:
1) Stand in zone 3 and walk to the furthest corner tile (closest to zone 2).
2) Click the nearest diagonal tile in zone 2: sometimes/usually succeeds.
3) From any other position in zone 3, click a tile in zone 1: fails to cross
   into zone 2 (never completes the diagonal hop).
4) Even from the exact corner tile, click any diagonal tile other than the
   closest one: fails to complete the hop.

Bug 6: Minimap diagonal click never completes the hop
-----------------------------------------------------
Minimap diagonal clicks never enter the diagonal zone. The player walks along
the seam of the sideways zone but never makes it into the diagonal zone.

Repro:
1) From zone 3, minimap-click a tile in diagonal zone 2.
2) Player walks along the seam of zone 1/4 but never crosses into zone 2.
