Zone Transition Bugs — Current State (2026-02-02)
==================================================

Bug 3: Ground/tile shift on zone transition
--------------------------------------------
On zone switch, the tiles visually shift in one direction underneath the
character — like the camera or tile layer jumps briefly. Not a shake
(no oscillation), just a single-direction shift that settles. Looks
like a brief earthquake or the camera snapping to a new position.
Likely related to the same frame spike that causes the audio skip.

Bug 4: Diagonal cross-zone click routes to wrong adjacent zone
---------------------------------------------------------------
Click-to-move across diagonal zones (e.g., zone 1 → zone 4, or zone 2 → zone 3)
does not route to the clicked destination. The player often crosses into one
of the orthogonally adjacent zones instead, ending in the wrong zone and never
reaching the clicked tile.

Repro:
1) Stand in zone 3 and click a tile in zone 2 (diagonal target).
2) Player walks, but transitions into zone 1 or 4 instead of zone 2.
3) Same issue for zone 1 → zone 4 and zone 2 → zone 3, both directions.
