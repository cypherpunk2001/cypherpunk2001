Bug 4: Diagonal cross-zone click routes to wrong adjacent zone
---------------------------------------------------------------
Click-to-move across diagonal zones (e.g., zone 1 → zone 4, or zone 2 → zone 3)
does not route to the clicked destination. The player often crosses into one
of the orthogonally adjacent zones instead, ending in the wrong zone and never
reaching the clicked tile.

Repro:
1) Stand in zone 3 and click a tile in zone 2 (diagonal target).
2) Player walks, but transitions into zone 1 or 4 instead of zone 2.
3) Same issue for zone 1 → zone 4 and zone 2 → zone 3, both directions.
