Zone Transition Bugs — Fix Plan (2026-02-02)
=============================================

COMPLETED (committed in 0a58afe)
=================================
- Tile skipping: seam translation uses actual position + 1px edge-push
- Keyboard crossing: near-zero threshold (0.5), cooldown 0.5s
- Dead sprite at edge: edge-strips cleared on zone change
- Non-crossing targets clamped to destination bounds


REMAINING BUGS — 3 open
=========================

Phase 1: Fix infinite walking (Bug 1) — HIGHEST PRIORITY
----------------------------------------------------------
Files: src/main.lisp

ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED: The previous fix cleared (player-intent player)
but NOT (game-client-intent game). The client-intent is the one actually
sent to the server every frame and also applied locally in run-local
(main.lisp:984-985). The stale client-intent overwrites the cleared
player intent on the very next tick via apply-client-intent
(server.lisp:129-134), reintroducing the old-zone target.

Fix: In handle-zone-transition (main.lisp:716-729), ALSO clear the
target fields on game-client-intent:
  (let ((ci (game-client-intent game)))
    (when ci
      (clear-intent-target ci)))

This ensures the stale target is not re-sent to the server or re-applied
locally. The existing player-intent clear stays as a belt-and-suspenders.

Consider also: Reset the mouse-hold/click-to-move input state so the
client doesn't immediately re-issue a walk command from the still-held
mouse button. Check update-client-input for persistent click state.

Tests:
  - Verify game-client-intent target is cleared after zone change
  - Verify walk terminates in destination zone (not infinite)
  - Verify stale target is not re-applied after one sim tick


Phase 2: Fix audio skip (Bug 2) and tile shift (Bug 3)
--------------------------------------------------------
Bug 2 (audio skip) is caused by synchronous work in apply-zone-to-world
(5-20ms frame spike on main thread). Bug 3 (tile shift) is primarily
caused by camera pixel snapping (rendering.lisp:89-97), with the frame
spike making it more visible.

Step 1: Profile apply-zone-to-world
  - Measure time for each operation: wall-map rebuild, zone-paths scan,
    minimap rebuild, collision recalc
  - Identify which operations are redundant (zone is already in LRU cache)

Step 2: Eliminate redundant work
  - Zone wall-map is already computed at load time (zone-wall-map). The
    current code just assigns it — this should be fast. Check if
    build-zone-paths or minimap rebuild is the real cost.
  - Pre-compute derived data (wall bounds, minimap) during zone preload
    rather than on transition.

Step 3: Fix tile shift specifically
  Option A (preferred): After zone transition, force the new player
  position to have the same fractional-pixel alignment as the old
  position. This makes the snap formula produce consistent rounding.
  Option B: Skip the snap formula for 1-2 frames after transition.
  Option C: Round spawn position to integer coordinates.

Step 4: If frame spike can't be fully eliminated, defer heavy work:
  - Pre-build derived data for adjacent zones during gameplay (when
    player is near an edge, precompute the destination zone's data)
  - Render cache cost is now mostly from cold cache build, not blanket
    invalidation (clear-other-zone-render-caches keeps the destination
    zone warm if already cached). Spread cold cache rebuilding over
    multiple frames if needed.

Tests: Measure frame time during zone transition (should be < 16ms).
       Verify no visible tile shift. Verify audio continuity.


Verification
============
After each phase:
  - make tests (all tests must pass)
  - Manual: click-to-move across zone boundary, verify walk stops
  - Manual: keyboard walk across zone boundary, verify smooth crossing
  - Manual: listen for audio skip on zone change
  - Manual: watch for tile/ground shift on zone change
