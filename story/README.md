## Runescape Classic Reimagined

- 2d mmo style, no rotating camera because 2d

- no lock on 3 rounds mele system

- no tedious magick system

- ability to run

- world time + night and day mode

- we'll focus on building some towns similar to the lumbridge -> varrock -> falador -> draynor village round trip just in the 2d style

- pvp can happen inbetween major cities, perhaps everyone can join the same faction being a city

- time travel is possible in to a 2d mmorpg cyberpunk 2077 type of gig

- in the future realm is night clubs where users can DJ livecoding using common lisp using something
like https://commonmusic.sourceforge.net/ or https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/clm/, cars to mount instead of horses e.g. more open worldish style wild west type play, like imagine if cyberpunk 2077 really was multi player, just we dont have the graphics

- mail boxes ala email / attach items from bank or send received items to bank

- zone editor mode for player mods to build out the world further

- monastery has player managed lore library
